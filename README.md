## Motivation
Human capital is one of the best indicators of someone’s success on the job market. People with higher education tend to have higher earnings after graduation. The main purpose of this research project is to investigate if the inheritance of this aspect of human capital occurs in society. If the answer is affirmative, more resources should be spent on education since it will benefit society in later generations. Moreover, inequalities will emerge because of this mechanism and some taxes might be proposed.

## Technology
We used R in order to obtain a multiple linear regression we had derived from theory and other statistical measures. 

## Dataset
Dataset used in our research: [database](https://www.bls.gov/nls/getting-started/accessing-data.htm). 
8,984 men and women who were resident in the country at the time of the initial survey in 1997 made up the nationally representative sample known as the NLSY97.  As of December 31, 1996, participants ranged in age from 12 to 16.  From 1997 through 2011, interviews were done yearly, and since then, they've been done every two years.  As of now, 18 surveys have been conducted with the ongoing cohort.  From Round 1 (1997–1998 to Round 19–2019–20), data are available.
